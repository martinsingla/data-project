Contributors: Andrés Estrada, Sonia Suárez Serafín, Pablo Villalpando & Martín Singla

#### _Project Description_
In the present project we explore the correlations between active Covid-19 cases in Mexico City, subsequent governmental restrictions and its impacts on economic activity across the city. We aim to shed some light on an ongoing debate in the public agendas of city governments across the globa, how to deal with the economic toll of lockdown restrictions in the context of a global sanitary crisis without precedents in the XXI century. 

We further explore the correlation between levels of informal economic activity / street markets and the rise of Covid cases in those boroughs. We can see that the most affected boroughs across Mexico City do tend to match with those socially more vulnerable and with higher levels of informal and/or street economic activity.

The main results of our study are showcased in the attached PDF presentation. All our workbooks and databases are included too.
